# JobOffers_DataLoad
 part that inserts data to MongoDB and PostgreSQL

To use it u should already have MongoDB and PostgresSQL databases created either locally or on remote host.

Databases credentials are required to make connection.
For this purpose we creaded .env file that contains environment variables holding databases credentials.

To use this approach you also have to install python-dotenv library which we omitted in requirements.txt

pip install python-dotenv

Contact me directly for .env file.

See example_use.py for details.
